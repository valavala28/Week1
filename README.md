Developed a linear regression model to predict solar power generation using environmental data (e.g., temperature). Preprocessed a dataset with 21 columns and 4,213 rows, containing variables like temperature, humidity, and cloud cover. Key analyses included statistical summaries, correlations, and visualizations (e.g., temperature vs. power).
